The neural_network.py is making use of an mnist dataset which is a datasets of hand written digit, from 0-9 and able to predict the new digit, it Nueral network contains one input layer, two hidden layer and an output layer, with each layer having neurons of 500. During the training process an adaptive method was used for the learning rate
